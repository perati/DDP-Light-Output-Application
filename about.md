**Light output requirement calculation**<br>
This application evaluates the light intensity needed for a given area to enable the user to make the correct selection of light source type and quantity.<br><br>

**Step 1**<br>
The user is expected to input the specific characteristics of the area. Each type of area require different amount of ***light intensity*** based on the type of tasks performed in that area. It can be assumed that a kitchen that food is prepared needs more light than a living room intended for relaxing.<br>
**Step 2**<br>
The ***area characteristics*** are also important as the dimensions, and surfaces light reflection affect the spread of light in the area. So, the user should input the length, width, and height (distance between the floor and the light source), as well as the surface height we want to illuminate (i.e. floor, kithcen bench, coffee table).<br>
**Step 3**<br>
Also the colour of the wall and ceiling are required to calculate the **surface light reflection** as lighter colour reflect more light, and in return need less light source output to achieve the same result if complared with a darker coloured surface.<br><br>

**Definitions**<br>
Area light intensity requirement: The amount of light required to illuminate an area is measured in Lux.<br>
Light Source: a light emitter such as a headlamp, fluorescent lamp, and light bulb.<br>
Light output: the total light output emmited from a light source measured in Lumens.<br><br>

**Result evaluation**<br>
The input requested will be used to calculate the light intensity required for the area. This number indicates the light intensity required. What is needed is to select a light source that mathes this number. Note that light sources such as bulbs and fluorescent lamps, all have in the manufacturers characteristics the light output they emmit (indicated on the package). So, an area requiring 10000 lumens of light intensity can be adequately lighten with light sources with total light output (lux) of that amount. This can be achieved by a single light source emitting 10000 lux or 2 emitting 5000.<br><br>

**Notes**
Note that this application is made for the scope of this project which is to illustrate the use of ***shiny***. It uses a simplified version of the process to be followed for the calculation of the light intensity requirements. For this reason the results can only be considered as an approximation of the correct value.<br><br>
